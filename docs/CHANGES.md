## Pushing Changes to Github

In order to push your changes to github you will need to checkout and create your own branch.

-   Do this by typing:

```bash
  git checkout -b <your_initials> / <ticket_number> _ <component_you_are_working_on>
```

for example

```bash
 git checkout -b AS/FA-338_README
```

-   Make sure you make your own so that things stay organized and you get credit for your work.

-   Once you do that commit the changes in VS Code clicking on the branch icon on the left sidebar. You will see the “Changes” dropdown showing what needs to be pushed to github.

-   Mouse over each change you want to commit and click the “+” sign to add the item.

-   Then add a comment to the Message field above.

-   Click the commit button then click publish.
